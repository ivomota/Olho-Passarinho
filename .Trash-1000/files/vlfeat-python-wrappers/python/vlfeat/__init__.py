	descriptor (see VL_SIFT()). This function calculates quickly a large number
	of such descriptors, for a dense covering of the image with features of the
	same size and orientation.\n\n
	
	The function returns the frames F and the descriptors D. Since all frames
	have identical size and orientation, F has only two rows (for the X and Y
	center coordinates). The orientation is fixed to zero. The scale is related
	to the SIZE of the spatial bins, which by default is equal to 3 pixels (see
	below). If NS is the number of bins in each spatial direction (by default
	4), then a DSIFT keypoint covers a square patch of NS by SIZE pixels.\n\n
	
	@remark The size of a SIFT bin is equal to the magnification factor MAGNIF 
	(usually 3) by the scale of the SIFT keypoint. This means that the scale of
	the SIFT keypoints corresponding to the DSIFT descriptors is SIZE / MAGNIF.
